I am Kai Yang, an A*STAR researcher trying to learn and run micromagnetic simulation with mumax3. 

This repository recorded my learning process which might also be helpful for future generation of users. The basic tutorial is given by Xiaoye. A beginner should first go through the basic tutorial. 

Moving on, I tried to simulate results from the literature (Xioye et. al, 2022). I tried to simulate the four different stacks at zero field, then simulate their hysteresis.
